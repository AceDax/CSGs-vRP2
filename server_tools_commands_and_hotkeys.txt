FIRE SCRIPT
/startfire NUMFLAMES RADIUS. NUMFLAMES determines the maximum number of flames the fire will have (maximum 100), while RADIUS specifies the radius of the fire in metres (maximum 30). /startfire 40 10 is a good starting point.
/stopfire. This stops all fires within a 35 metre radius (you can also extinguish fires normally).
/stopallfires. This stops all fires on the map.
/startsmoke SCALE. You're also able to create 'smoke without fire' e.g. for a call where someone gets concerned for fire over barbecue smoke. SCALE is replaced by a number (recommended to keep it between 0.5-5) that indicates the magnitude of the smoke. E.g. /startsmoke 1
/stopsmoke. Stops all smoke without fire within a 35 metre radius.
/stopallsmoke. Stops all smoke without fire on the map.
