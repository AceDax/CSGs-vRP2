Hi everyone,

I just made a simple script that allows you to rise your hands by pressing "X".

Features :

1. Press X to raise your hands
2. Move while raising your hands
3. Don't impact the position of the player


Instalation : 

1. Download from github
2. Unrar "vk_handsup" folder in your resources folder
3. Add "vk_handsup" to your AutostartResources in citmp-server.yml
4. Have fun !

Changing the controls :

1. Go to https://wiki.fivem.net/wiki/Controls and choose the key that you want to use
2. Edit "client.lua", goto line 22 and change by your desired index
3. Same for line 39
